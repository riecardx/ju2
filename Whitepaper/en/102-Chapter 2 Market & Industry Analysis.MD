# Chapter 2 Market & Industry Analysis



### 2.1 Industry Development Stages and Trends



Since the “DeFi Summer” in 2020, decentralized exchanges (DEXs) have risen rapidly and become critical infrastructure for global digital asset trading. According to DefiLlama, as of Q3 2025, the average monthly trading volume of DEXs worldwide has exceeded USD 1.2 trillion—over 30 times higher than in 2020—demonstrating continued exponential growth.



The development of DEXs can be divided into three major stages:



1️⃣ **Initial Stage (2017–2019):**  

Represented by early platforms such as EtherDelta and IDEX—complex interfaces, limited liquidity, and high operational barriers.



2️⃣ **Boom Stage (2020–2022):**  

The launch of Uniswap V2/V3, SushiSwap, PancakeSwap, etc., introduced the AMM (Automated Market Maker) model, greatly simplifying trading logic. Liquidity mining accelerated user and capital growth.



3️⃣ **Optimization & Integration Stage (2023–present):**  

DEXs began to converge with CEX functionalities, introducing cross-chain aggregation, stablecoin pools, perpetual contracts, and Layer2 expansion, forming a multi-layer ecosystem with higher performance, lower cost, and broader asset coverage.



**Trend-wise**, the industry is evolving from *single-chain DEXs* to *multi-chain aggregators*, and from *trading platforms* to *autonomous financial ecosystems*.  

Over the next 2–3 years, key competitive factors will include:



- liquidity depth and aggregation capability,



- low fees and high execution efficiency,



- user experience and verifiable security,



- cross-chain interoperability and DAO governance frameworks.



### 2.2 Competitive Landscape Analysis



The current DEX market shows both **oligopolistic dominance** and **continuous innovation**.



- **Uniswap V3:** High capital efficiency via concentrated liquidity, strong brand, but complex deployment and high gas costs.



- **PancakeSwap:** Leading platform on BNB Chain with low fees and active ecosystem, but heavily limited by chain-specific constraints.



- **dYdX:** Leading perpetual DEX with a powerful matching engine but limited listing flexibility.



- **SushiSwap:** Multi-chain support and rich features (Farm, Launchpad), but governance instability.



- **Curve Finance:** Specialist in stablecoin swaps with extremely low slippage, but relatively narrow in functionality.



With the maturation of Layer2 and ZK Rollup technologies, DEX competition is shifting from “single-point performance” toward “comprehensive ecosystem strength.”  

JU2 adopts a “enhanced secondary development + DAO-driven” model to build a new-generation DEX that integrates liquidity efficiency, security, compliance readiness, and community autonomy.



### 2.3 User Pain Points and DEX Improvement Directions



While DEXs outperform centralized exchanges (CEXs) in security and transparency, ordinary users still face several challenges:



1.  **High gas fees & slow confirmations:**  

    JU2 will deploy on low-gas, high-performance chains and support Layer2 aggregated transactions.



2.  **Complex operation:**  

    JU2 refines UI/UX to support one-click swap and automatic slippage optimization.



3.  **Slippage & price instability:**  

    JU2 introduces intelligent liquidity aggregation algorithms and a dynamic fee model.



4.  **Low governance participation:**  

    JU2 provides a visualized voting interface and mobile DAO portal.



5.  **Inconvenient cross-chain operations:**  

    JU2 incorporates a cross-chain asset bridge and offers a unified multi-chain trading interface.



JU2 aims to deliver **CEX-level experience + DEX-level security + community-driven governance**, offering users low-cost, high-efficiency, and trustworthy decentralized trading services.



### 2.4 Timing and Market Potential for JU2



2024–2025 is a critical window for structural evolution in the DEX industry. With tightening regulation on centralized exchanges, expanding on-chain asset scale, and increasing institutional participation, user demand for secure, transparent, and autonomous financial systems is rising sharply.



The global DEX market remains in a phase of high growth yet far from saturation:



- Approximately **70 million crypto users worldwide** have used DEXs;



- DEX volume accounts for **20–25%** of global crypto trading;



- Emerging markets show rapidly increasing on-chain activity.



**Advantages of JU2：**



- **Technology Layer:** Built on mature open-source DEX frameworks, enabling fast and stable deployment.



- **Cost Layer:** Deployment on high-performance chains significantly reduces user transaction costs.



- **Ecosystem Layer:** DAO treasury and incentive mechanisms encourage community-driven liquidity growth.



- **Financing Layer:** Balanced token allocation and reasonable valuation attract strategic investors.



**Conclusion:**  

JU2 enters the market at the intersection of **technological optimization** and **governance upgrades**, positioning itself with strong potential to become a next-generation integrated DEX platform.
