# Chapter 5 Governance & DAO Mechanism



### 5.1 Overview of DAO Governance



The core vision of JU2 is **“Ownership by Community.”**  

To achieve this goal, JU2 established a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) governance system from the early stage of the project, enabling all token holders to directly participate in strategic decision-making and resource allocation of the platform.



The principles of JU2 DAO include:



1.  **Decentralization**: Governance power is not concentrated in the founding team but shared among token holders;



2.  **Transparency**: All proposals, votes, and execution processes are publicly recorded on-chain;



3.  **Incentive Alignment**: Governance actions are tied to token value, encouraging long-term participation;



4.  **Evolution**: The DAO structure can be continuously optimized based on community consensus, maintaining flexibility and adaptability.



JU2 DAO is not only a governance framework but also the core mechanism ensuring the project’s long-term sustainability.



### 5.2 DAO Treasury Management Mechanism



The DAO Treasury is the community’s public fund pool, managed through a DAO multi-signature wallet, and all operations must be executed through community voting or authorized procedures.



Treasury funding sources include:



1.  A portion of platform trading fees (25% of platform revenue);



2.  A portion of JU2 tokens injected after monthly buybacks (50%);



3.  Ecosystem project returns and investment income;



4.  Other revenue approved by DAO proposals.



Fund usage directions are determined through DAO proposals and voting, including:



- **Ecosystem Grants**: Supporting community developers, partner projects, research, and education initiatives;



- **Market Incentives**: Supporting marketing, content creation, and liquidity expansion;



- **Buyback & Burn**: Maintaining token price stability and supporting long-term value growth;



- **Reserves & Emergency Fund**: Handling security incidents or extreme market volatility;



- **Infrastructure Development**: Funding cross-chain bridges, security audits, node operations, and public utilities.



All treasury expenditures are executed via on-chain multi-signature to ensure no single-point control and full traceability.



### 5.3 Proposal → Vote → Execute Process



JU2 DAO governance follows a three-stage mechanism:  

**Proposal → Vote → Execute**



**(1) Proposal Stage**



- Any account holding **more than 50,000 JU2** may submit a formal proposal;



- Proposal content includes adjustments to tokenomics parameters, fund usage, ecosystem partnerships, governance rule changes, etc.;



- Proposals must include detailed explanations, execution logic, and budget plans;



- All proposals are publicly displayed in the DAO announcement board and the on-chain governance portal for **72 hours** before entering the voting stage.



**(2) Voting Stage**



- All token holders may vote according to their proportional holdings;



- Voting duration is **7 days**;



- Voting weight follows the model defined in Section 4.4.2 (“Quarterly Average Holding + Historical Weighted Score”);



- Passing threshold: **affirmative votes $\geq$ 60%** of the total voting weight;



- Voting results are recorded on-chain in real time to prevent tampering.



**(3) Execution Stage**



- Once passed, proposals are automatically executed by DAO smart contracts or placed into the multi-signature pending queue;



- For proposals involving funds or contract modifications, an additional **48-hour Timelock safety window** is required;



- Execution status is synchronized to the DAO portal and visible in blockchain explorers.



This process ensures every decision is community-driven while maintaining a balance between security and efficiency.



### 5.4 Transition Path from Founding Team to DAO



The JU2 governance model includes a **three-phase power transition mechanism**, ensuring a smooth shift from initial centralization to full decentralization.



**Phase 1: Launch Phase**



- The core team temporarily controls technical and security-related permissions;



- The DAO Treasury is initially managed by the founding team’s multi-signature wallet;



- Main tasks: system development, audits, and initial community building.



**Phase 2: Co-Governance Phase**



- The DAO gradually takes over part of the treasury and proposal authority;



- Establishment of the **DAO Committee**, composed of both team and community members;



- Launch of the first community proposals and voting cycles;



- Founding team authority is reduced to below 50%.



**Phase 3: Full DAO Phase**



- All governance and treasury operations are fully transferred to the DAO;



- The founding team retains only technical advisory and security-related proposal privileges;



- Major platform decisions (protocol upgrades, fund allocation) are determined entirely by community votes;



- The DAO Committee oversees coordination and execution.



This transition ensures a safe and stable decentralization process, preventing governance gaps or early-stage security risks.



### 5.5 Treasury Allocation Logic



DAO fund allocation follows the principles of **transparency, fairness, and co-governance**, with quarterly DAO voting to review the annual budget plan.



Suggested allocation ranges (adjustable by community):



| **Fund Usage** | **Percentage Range** | **Description** |
|----|----|----|
| Ecosystem Grants | 30–40% | Funding community projects, developers, and partners |
| Buyback & Liquidity Support | 20–30% | Using stablecoin revenue to buy back JU2 and support market-making |
| Reserve Fund | 15–25% | Handling black swan events and security vulnerabilities |
| Marketing & Branding | 10–15% | Promotion, content marketing, community incentives |
| Tech & Security | 5–10% | Security audits, node maintenance, AI risk-control development |



The DAO publishes monthly financial reports to ensure transparent accounting.  

All income, expenditures, buybacks, and grant allocations are traceable on blockchain explorers.



### 5.6 Future Governance Evolution



The JU2 DAO governance model will evolve continuously based on community consensus. Development directions include:



1.  **SubDAO System**: Creating specialized SubDAOs for areas such as technology, security, and marketing;



2.  **Reputation System**: Incorporating contribution-based reputation scores alongside token holdings;



3.  **AI Governance Assistant**: Using AI to evaluate proposal quality and risks;



4.  **Cross-Chain Governance**: Achieving synchronized governance across multiple chains through cross-chain bridges;



5.  **Compliance Layer**: Addressing regulatory requirements across global jurisdictions to ensure lawful operation.



**Conclusion**



JU2’s DAO governance system is built on the principle of **“Code is Law”**, achieving autonomous operation through smart contracts and community consensus.  

It is not only a governance tool but also the institutional foundation ensuring sustainability, fair value distribution, and long-term trust within the ecosystem.



JU2 is committed to becoming the most transparent, fair, and sustainable decentralized governance model in the industry.
