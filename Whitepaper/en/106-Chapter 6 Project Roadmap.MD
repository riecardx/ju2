# Chapter 6 Project Roadmap



The JU2 project roadmap consists of five major phases, covering the full cycle from core architecture development, smart contract deployment, mainnet launch, DAO governance takeover, to multi-chain ecosystem expansion. The overall planning period is approximately **24–36 months**, with specific timelines dynamically adjusted based on technical progress and community governance outcomes.



JU2’s development philosophy is based on **security-first, transparency, steady iteration, and community co-governance**, ensuring the construction of a sustainable decentralized trading ecosystem from technology to community.



In the new plan, an **overlapping phases** development model is adopted to improve efficiency, shorten the mainnet launch cycle, and maintain a balance between security and ecosystem growth.



### 6.1 Phase One: System Architecture Design & Smart Contract Development (Month 0–6｜Aligned with Pre-Seed)



**Objective:** Complete core system design, smart contract suite development, and front-end prototype.



**Key Work Items**



• Complete JU2’s overall technical architecture  

(Front-end, AMM, Router, Aggregation Layer, DAO, API Gateway)  

• Develop AMM core contract (AMM-Lite v1)  

• Develop Router / Factory / Liquidity Pool contracts  

• Develop basic governance contracts (Governance Framework v1)  

• Build front-end UI prototype (Web) and mobile adaptation framework  

• Complete unit testing, simulated trading tests, and basic performance testing  

• Build multi-signature treasury and DAO contract framework (not yet activated)



**Deliverables**



• JU2 Smart Contract Suite v1.0 (AMM + Router + Factory + LP + Governance)  

• Front-end UI Prototype  

• Automated test coverage $\geq$ 85%  

• Technical Whitepaper Draft (Technical Whitepaper v0.9)  

• New Tokenomics Mathematical Model (Tokenomic Model Beta)



### 6.2 Phase Two: Testnet Deployment, Security Audit & A/B Public Testing (Month 4–12｜Pre-Seed → Seed)



(Note: Phase Two overlaps with Phase One for 2 months between Month 4–6)



**Objective:** Complete full Testnet, public testing, security audits, and performance optimization.



**Key Work Items**



• Deploy full DEX suite on BNB Chain Testnet / Arbitrum Sepolia  

• Launch Testnet A (Closed Testing) and Testnet B (Public Testing)  

• Adjust AMM parameters based on data (concentrated liquidity, fee models)  

• Gas optimization for contracts (Router, Pool, Swap Path optimization)  

• Engage third-party audit firms (CertiK / PeckShield / SlowMist)  

• Launch the first performance stress test  

• Launch Bug Bounty (security vulnerability bounty program)



**Deliverables**



• JU2 Full Testnet (Testnet Environment v1.0)  

• Smart contracts pass at least one top-tier audit  

• Public testing analysis and economic model validation report (Economic Simulation Report)  

• Official Whitepaper (Whitepaper v1.0)  

• Testnet Users 10,000+ (Target)



### 6.3 Phase Three: Mainnet Launch, Token Issuance & Continuous Incentives (Month 12–20｜Seed → Private)



**Objective:** Complete Mainnet deployment (Mainnet V1), JU2 Token Generation Event (TGE), launch first trading pairs, and initiate continuous airdrop incentives.



**(1) Token Issuance Method (TGE + Weekly Airdrop)**



During Phase Three, the JU2 token is officially issued (TGE) and a continuous airdrop mechanism is launched.



**Weekly Airdrop Incentive Mechanism**



• Runs from Month 12 to Month 20  

• Distributed weekly according to on-chain rules  

• Reward criteria:  

o Trading Volume  

o Active Score  

o User Tier



**Airdrop Source: Community Incentives Pool**



• From the 300,000,000 JU2 (300 million) defined in Tokenomics  

• No lock-up  

• DAO may adjust distribution speed via proposals



**(2) Key Work Items**



• Mainnet deployment (BNB Chain / Arbitrum One / Base expandable)  

• Launch JU2 Token (TGE + Listing)  

• Initiate weekly trading incentive airdrops  

• Launch first mainstream trading pairs:  

o USDT / ETH / BNB / JU2  

• Integrate with wallets (MetaMask / OKX Wallet / Rabby)  

• Integrate with aggregators (1inch / ParaSwap / OpenOcean)  

• Integrate with market data platforms (CoinGecko / CoinMarketCap)



**(3) Deliverables**



• JU2 Mainnet v1.0 stable operation  

• JU2 / USDT and JU2 / ETH spot pairs officially open for trading  

• Trading volume steadily increases (Trading Volume Growth Cycle \#1)  

• Phase One airdrops fully executed  

• Buyback Cycle \#1 activated  

• Whitepaper v1.1 (with real economic model data)



### 6.4 Phase Four: DAO Launch, Governance Transition & Mining Incentives V2 (Month 20–26｜Private → Public)



**Objective:** Transition from team-led to DAO-led governance and launch the DAO-based mining incentive system.



**(1) Incentive Source & Method (Mining Rewards Phase)**



Starting in Phase Four, incentives no longer come from the Community Incentives Pool but shift to:



**Second-Phase Incentives (Mining Rewards Phase)**



• Trade Mining  

• LP Mining  

• Weekly Airdrop Model (unchanged)



**Airdrop Source: DAO Treasury**



• DAO may release up to **5% of treasury balance per month**  

• Rewards distributed automatically based on:  

o Trading Volume  

o LP Contribution  

o Staking Duration



**(2) Key Work Items**



• Full launch of DAO voting system (DAO Voting v1.0)  

• Establish DAO Committee  

• DAO takes over:  

o Treasury management  

o Ecosystem grants (Grants Program)  

o Buyback execution  

• Launch Mining Rewards System v2  

• Launch Community Developer Fund  

• Establish Security Fund  

• Gradually reduce founding team governance rights to below 20%



**(3) Deliverables**



• DAO becomes the sole governance authority  

• Treasury, buyback, and ecosystem expansion fully controlled by DAO  

• Trade mining & LP mining systems operate steadily  

• Community Developer Fund, Marketing Fund, Risk Fund launched  

• Governance Architecture v2.0 (SubDAO structure) established



### 6.5 Phase Five: Ecosystem Expansion, Multi-Chain Deployment & Aggregator Upgrade (Month 26–30｜Post-Public)



**Objective:** Expand to multi-chain, upgrade AMM, and scale ecosystem modularity.



**Key Work Items**



• Multi-chain deployment (Arbitrum + Base + BNB + Optimism)  

• JU2 Aggregation Engine upgrade (Aggregation Engine v2.0)  

• New routing paths & cross-chain swaps  

• Institutional market maker integration (MM Integration)  

• Developer SDK suite for third-party integration  

• Launch SubDAO ecosystem (regional DAO / developer DAO)  

• Expand global communities (Japan, Korea, SEA, US, EU)



**Deliverables**



• JU2 becomes a multi-chain DEX  

• Aggregator performance comparable to 1inch / OpenOcean  

• Significant growth in ecosystem developers  

• DAO achieves stable governance and global expansion
