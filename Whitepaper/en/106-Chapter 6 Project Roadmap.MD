# Chapter 6 Project Roadmap



The JU2 project roadmap is divided into five main phases, covering the full cycle from core architecture development and smart contract deployment to mainnet launch, DAO governance takeover, and multi-chain ecosystem expansion.  

The overall planning cycle spans approximately **24–36 months**, with specific timelines dynamically adjusted based on technical progress and community governance decisions.



JU2’s development philosophy is built on **security-first, transparency, steady iteration, and community co-governance**, ensuring the gradual construction of a sustainable decentralized trading ecosystem from technology to ecosystem development.



The new roadmap adopts **Overlapping Phases** to enhance development efficiency, shorten the mainnet launch cycle, and balance security with ecosystem growth.



### 6.1 Phase One: System Architecture & Smart Contract Development (0–6 Months)



**Objective:** Complete core system design and smart contract development.



**Main Work Items**



- Complete overall architecture design (Front-end, AMM, Aggregator, DAO, unified API)



- Develop AMM core contracts, Router, Liquidity Pool, Governance Contract



- Create front-end UI prototype and mobile adaptation



- Complete unit testing and basic performance testing



- Build multisig treasury and DAO contract framework (not yet activated)



**Phase Deliverables**



- JU2 Smart Contract Suite v1.0 (AMM + Router + LP + Governance)



- Front-end prototype system online



- Test script coverage $\geq$ 85%



- Technical version of the whitepaper (v0.9)



### 6.2 Phase Two: Testnet Deployment & Security Audit (4–9 Months)



*Note: Phase Two overlaps with Phase One for 2 months (Months 4–6) to improve overall efficiency.*



**Objective:** Ensure system stability, security, and usability.



**Main Work Items**



- Deploy full platform on BNB Chain Testnet / Arbitrum Sepolia



- Launch public testing (Testnet A/B Round)



- Conduct gas optimization and AMM performance tuning



- Initiate third-party audits (CertiK / PeckShield, etc.)



- Launch first round of user stress testing



- Start Bug Bounty program



**Phase Deliverables**



- JU2 full Testnet running stably



- Smart contracts approved by at least one top-tier audit firm



- Public testing data & tokenomics validation report



- Official version of the whitepaper (v1.0)



### 6.3 Phase Three: Mainnet Launch & Token Issuance (9–18 Months)



**Objective:** Mainnet deployment, token launch, and continuous airdrop incentives.



**(1) Token Issuance Mechanism — Updated Explanation**



JU2 Token will be issued in this phase via a:



**Weekly Airdrop (Continuous Airdrop) Mechanism**



- Weekly airdrops throughout the entire Phase Three (Months 9–18)



- Airdrop method:  

  **Trading Rewards = Transaction Volume $\times$ Activity Level**



- Airdrop source:  

  **Community Incentives (300,000,000 JU2)**



- All airdrops fully transparent and verifiable on-chain



- No lock-up period, though DAO may adjust reward speed through proposals



**(2) Main Work Items**



- Mainnet deployment (BNB Chain / Arbitrum One)



- JU2 Token Listing (TGE)



- Launch weekly trading incentive airdrops



- Launch initial trading pairs (USDT, ETH, BNB, major assets)



- Complete early-stage user acquisition



- Integrate with wallets, aggregators, and market data platforms



**(3) Phase Deliverables (Important Updates)**



**🚀 Final Deliverable: JU2 Spot Trading Market Live**



At the end of Phase Three:



- JU2/USDT, JU2/ETH and other spot trading pairs officially open



- Stable growth of user trading volume achieved



- Completion of the first Community Airdrop Phase



- Buyback Cycle \#1 initiated



- Whitepaper v1.1 (with real-tokenomics performance data)



### 6.4 Phase Four: DAO Establishment, Governance Takeover & Mining Incentives (18–24 Months)



**Objective:** Transition from team-led governance to DAO-led governance and launch the second incentive phase.



**(1) Incentive Source & Method — Updated Explanation**



Phase Four continues to provide mining rewards, but no longer uses the Community Incentive Pool.  

Instead, rewards come from:



**Second Incentive Phase (Mining Rewards Phase)**



- **Trade Mining**



- **LP Mining**



Rewards continue using the **Weekly Airdrop** model.



**Airdrop Source:** DAO Treasury



DAO Treasury will release a certain percentage of JU2 monthly for mining incentives:



- Release Limit: **Up to 5% of DAO Treasury balance per month**



- Distribution Method: Weighted by trading volume, LP contribution, and staking duration



- All distributions publicly visible on-chain



This establishes a smooth transition from **Community Incentives → DAO Incentives**, supporting long-term platform sustainability.



**(2) Main Work Items**



- Full launch of DAO voting system



- Establishment of the DAO Committee



- DAO takeover of treasury funds, ecosystem grants, buyback execution, etc.



- Initiate DAO-based mining incentive system



- Build security fund and reserve fund module



- Gradual reduction of founding team governance permissions (down to below 20%)



**(3) Phase Deliverables**



- DAO fully controls governance authority and treasury management



- Trade Mining & LP Mining airdrops executed according to DAO decisions



- DAO voting activity reaches a stable participation level



- Establishment of community developer fund, market fund, and risk fund



- Completion of Governance Architecture v2.0 (initial SubDAO framework formed)
