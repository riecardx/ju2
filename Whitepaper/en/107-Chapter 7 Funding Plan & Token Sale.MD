# Chapter 7 Funding Plan & Token Sale



JU2’s funding plan is built around three core principles:  

**Long-term value, transparent governance, and stable vesting**, ensuring sustainable project operation, mainnet delivery, user growth, and cross-chain ecosystem expansion.



JU2’s financing structure consists of three components:  

**Funding Rounds (Seed → Private → Public) + Token Locking Mechanism + Transparent Fund Management.**



All raised funds and token distributions are governed by **smart contract custody, multi-signature wallet oversight, and on-chain transparency**, ensuring full trust for both investors and the community.



### 7.1 Vesting Model for Investors



All JU2 tokens allocated to the three funding rounds follow the same vesting rules:



**(1) Lock-up Period (Cliff)**



- Begins after the token is listed and spot trading goes live



- **6-month lock-up (180 days)**



- Tokens cannot be sold or transferred during the lock-up period



**(2) Linear Vesting Period**



- After the 6-month lock-up ends



- **12 months of linear vesting**



- Daily automatic release: Total amount / 365



**(3) Total Vesting Cycle**



**18 months (6 + 12)**



This structure ensures stable project growth, prevents short-term sell pressure, and encourages long-term investor participation.



### 7.2 Seed Round Funding Plan



**Target Amount:**  

300 ETH



**Minimum Investment:**



- Participation in units of **10 ETH**



**Token Allocation:**  

**100,000,000 JU2 (100 million)**  

Divided into two parts:



| **Portion** | **Trigger Condition** | **Corresponding Tokens** | **Multiplier Description** |
|----|----|----|----|
| First Portion | When 60% of target is reached (180 ETH) | 72,000,000 JU2 | 1.2$\times$ token allocation multiplier |
| Second Portion | Settled at the end of Seed Round | 28,000,000 JU2 | 0.7$\times$ token allocation multiplier |



**(1) Trigger Condition**



When the raised amount reaches **180 ETH (60% of target)**:



- Phase One and Phase Two development work begins immediately



- 72 million JU2 allocated to the seed round are released



- Team enters full development mode (architecture, contracts, testnet)



**(2) Funding Deadline Rules**



- The Seed Round automatically closes **30 days** after launch



- All unsold tokens (the remaining 40%, i.e., 28,000,000 JU2)  

  → **Return entirely to the DAO Treasury**



DAO Treasury usage includes:



- Security reserve



- Community governance rewards



- Future incentive programs



Ensuring shared value for the community from unpurchased allocations.



**(3) Investor Return Model**



- Expected return period: **24 months**



- Expected ROI: **11,400%**



Estimated based on platform growth, buyback mechanisms, and long-term ecosystem expansion.



### 7.3 Private Round Funding Plan



**Target Amount:**  

1500 ETH



**Minimum Investment:**



- Participation in units of **50 ETH**



**Token Allocation:**  

**100,000,000 JU2 (100 million)**



**(1) Time Window**



- Begins when Phase Two (Testnet Deployment) starts



- Ends when Phase Three (Mainnet Launch) begins



- Or ends early if the target amount is reached



**(2) Handling of Unsold Tokens**



- Any tokens not purchased by the end of the round  

  → **Automatically injected into the DAO Treasury**



DAO Treasury usage includes:



- Project operations



- Ecosystem expansion



- Liquidity building



- Buyback & reserve funds



**(3) Investor Return Model**



- Expected return period: **15 months**



- Expected ROI: **1,900%**



Suitable for institutional investors and strategic partners.



### 7.4 Public Sale Funding Plan



**Target Amount:**  

5000 ETH



**Minimum Investment:**



- Participation in units of **100 ETH**  

  (Threshold may be lowered via DAO proposals)



**Token Allocation:**  

**100,000,000 JU2 (100 million)**



**(1) Time Window**



- Begins at the start of Phase Three (Mainnet Launch)



- Ends when Phase Four begins (token spot trading goes live)



- Or ends early if the target amount is reached



**(2) Dynamic ETH/JU2 Rate**



During the public sale:



- DAO votes monthly to adjust the ETH/JU2 ratio



- Adjustments consider market conditions, TVL, trading volume, user growth



- Ensures fairness and smooth price transition for public investors



**(3) Handling of Unsold Tokens**



- All unsold tokens at the end of the public sale  

  → Injected into the DAO Treasury as long-term reserves



**(4) Investor Return Model**



- Expected return period: **6 months**



- Expected ROI: **850%**



Targeting the global community and early platform users.



### 7.5 Use of Funds



All funds are managed via a **DAO multi-signature wallet** and fully transparent on-chain.



**Recommended Fund Allocation**



| **Use of Funds** | **Percentage** | **Description** |
|----|----|----|
| Technology Development | 30–40% | Contract development, front-end, cross-chain bridge, full nodes, SDK |
| Security & Audit | 10–15% | Security audits, bug bounty, security fund |
| Marketing & Community | 20–30% | Global community growth, branding, partnership marketing |
| Liquidity Bootstrapping | 15–25% | Market making, LP incentives, cross-chain bridge liquidity |
| DAO Treasury Reserve | 10–20% | Emergency reserve, buyback fund, subDAO budgets |



**Transparency Mechanisms**



- All fund flows publicly visible on-chain



- DAO publishes quarterly **Treasury Reports**



- Major expenditures require governance proposal approval



### 7.6 Funding Structure Summary



| **Round** | **Target Amount** | **Investment Threshold** | **Token Allocation** | **Vesting Model** | **Unsold Tokens** | **Return Period** | **Expected ROI** |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| Seed | 300 ETH | 10 ETH | 100M | 6-month lock-up / 12-month vesting | Returned to DAO Treasury | 24 months | 11,400% |
| Private | 1500 ETH | 50 ETH | 100M | Same as above | Returned to DAO Treasury | 15 months | 1,900% |

**Conclusion**



JU2’s funding system is built on the principles of **sustainability, transparency, openness, and decentralization**, ensuring:



- Fair valuation



- Smart contract-based lock-up



- Multi-signature treasury management



- Stage-based funding triggers



- Unpurchased tokens returning to the DAO



- Clear fund usage and return models



This protects investor interests, supports long-term project development, and maintains DAO governance stability.



JU2’s goal is not rapid fundraising, but building a **community-owned, self-evolving decentralized trading ecosystem**.
