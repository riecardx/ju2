# Chapter 7 Funding Plan & Token Sale



JU2’s funding framework is designed around **long-term value, transparent governance, and decentralized evolution**.



The project’s goal is not to become a DEX controlled by the founding team, but ultimately a **community-owned decentralized trading ecosystem**.



Therefore, the token economy maintains:



• **30% token allocation for investors (unchanged)**  

• Team allocation unchanged, with longer vesting  

• DAO and community retain ultimate decision-making authority



JU2 believes that early investors are the most critical governance participants. Their expertise, long-term perspective, and economic alignment will form the **founding governance set** of the DAO.



This chapter explains JU2’s funding rounds, token sale mechanisms, vesting rules, and fund utilization.



### 7.1 Token Vesting Model



All investor tokens across all funding rounds follow a unified vesting model for fairness and long-term stability.



**(1) Cliff Period**



• Starts after token listing  

• 6-month (180 days) cliff  

• Tokens cannot be transferred or sold during this period



**(2) Linear Vesting**



• After the cliff  

• **Daily linear release over 12 months (Total $\div$ 365)**



**(3) Total Vesting Period**



18 months (6-month cliff + 12-month linear vesting)



This structure prevents short-term sell-offs and encourages long-term governance participation.



### 7.2 Four-Stage Funding Model Overview



JU2’s four funding rounds cover the full cycle from Testnet MVP → Mainnet → Multi-chain expansion → Global community scaling.



| **Round** | **Target Amount** | **Method** | **Phase Focus** | **Investor Token Pool** |
|----|----|----|----|----|
| Pre-Seed | 300,000 USD | Equity/SAFT | Complete Testnet MVP & Build Core Team | From 30% investor pool |
| Seed | 1,500,000 USD | SAFT | Mainnet, Audit, DAO Base | Same |
| Private | 5,000,000 USD | SAFT/Strategic | Multi-chain, TVL, Global BD | Same |
| Public Sale | 10–15M USD (DAO-adjustable) | Capped Public Sale | Community participation & ecosystem expansion | Same |



**The total investor allocation stays at 30%**, and tokens for each round are drawn from this pool, ensuring consistent Tokenomics.



### 7.3 Pre-Seed Round (300,000 USD)



**Goals**



• Build a 2–3 person core technical team  

• Complete Testnet MVP (v1 → v2)  

• Finalize Tokenomics 2.0 (mathematical model)  

• Establish initial legal structure (Foundation + Labs)



**Investment Participation (Co-Invest Friendly)**



This round supports:



• A single institutional or individual investor  

• Multiple co-investors



No fixed allocation ratio, no mandatory lead/ follow structure.  

Investors may participate according to their strategy and scale.



This model allows:



• Diverse governance participants  

• Stronger DAO foundations  

• Avoiding capital concentration  

• Sustainable governance structure



**Token Allocation**



From the 30% investor pool.



### 7.4 Seed Round (1,500,000 USD)



**Goals**



• Complete smart contract audits  

• Launch Mainnet V1  

• Deploy Liquidity Engine  

• Start DAO v1 (Treasury + Proposal System)



**Participation**



• SAFT  

• Supports single or multiple investors  

• Suitable for mid-sized institutional checks (25k–250k)



**Token Allocation**



From the investor pool, maintaining Tokenomics stability.



### 7.5 Private Round (5,000,000 USD)



**Goals**



• Multi-chain expansion (Arbitrum / Base / zkEVM)  

• Global BD, partners, exchange integrations  

• Liquidity incentive programs (LP Mining / Market Makers)  

• Strengthen security framework



**Participation**



• SAFT + Strategic Partnerships  

• Large institutional participation allowed  

• Co-investors welcome  

• Some contributions may be non-monetary (nodes, LP support)



**Token Allocation**



From the 30% investor pool (no extra dilution).



### 7.6 Public Sale (10–15M USD or DAO decision)



**Goals**



• Attract global community  

• Build genuine holder base  

• Support DAO expansion & TVL growth  

• Bring first batch of real trading users



**Capped Public Sale Mechanism**



To avoid whale domination:



• Minimum purchase per address  

• Maximum cap per address  

• DAO may adjust parameters



This approach is fairer and better suited for a community-owned DEX.



**Pricing Models**



Any of the following:



• LBP (Balancer-style)  

• Bonding Curve  

• DAO-controlled dynamic parameters



Manual price manipulation is not used for fairness and compliance.



**Unsold Tokens**



Returned to the DAO Treasury for:



• Security reserve  

• Liquidity reinforcement  

• Ecosystem incentives  

• Partnership programs  

• Long-term DAO budget



### 7.7 Use of Funds



All funds are managed by a DAO multi-signature wallet with transparent on-chain records.



| **Category** | **Allocation** | **Description** |
|----|----|----|
| Technology Development | 30–40% | Contracts, front-end, cross-chain, SDK, optimization |
| Security & Audits | 10–15% | Audits, bug bounty, security fund |
| Marketing & Community | 15–25% | Global user growth, regional markets, partnerships |
| Liquidity (TVL) | 20–30% | Market making, LP mining, cross-chain liquidity |
| DAO Treasury Reserve | 10–20% | Buyback fund, SubDAO budget, emergency reserve |



**Transparency Mechanisms**



• Quarterly DAO financial reports  

• Large expenditures require governance voting  

• All transactions are on-chain and publicly viewable
