# Chapter 9 Ecosystem & Future Development



JU2’s ecosystem is built around four strategic pillars:  

**trading-centric design, diversified ecosystem modules, community-driven governance, and cross-chain globalization.**



As the mainnet launches, the DAO takes over governance, and the token economy matures, JU2 will gradually evolve from a single DEX into a **self-evolving DeFi ecosystem** composed of multiple synergistic modules.



This chapter presents JU2’s ecosystem structure, strategic partnerships, and its development roadmap and expansion potential over the next 3–5 years.
