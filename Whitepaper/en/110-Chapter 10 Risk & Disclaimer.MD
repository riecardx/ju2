# Chapter 10 Risk & Disclaimer



The JU2 project adheres to the principles of openness, transparency, and responsibility, fully disclosing the risks users may face when using the platform or participating in the JU2 ecosystem.  

This chapter aims to help users, investors, and partners clearly understand potential risks, set reasonable expectations, and clarify the boundaries of responsibility between the platform and the DAO.



This chapter does **not** constitute legal advice, investment advice, or any form of guarantee.  

All users participating in the JU2 ecosystem should make decisions only after fully understanding these risks.



### 10.1 Market Risks



The cryptocurrency market is highly volatile, and prices may fluctuate sharply due to:



- Global or regional macroeconomic fluctuations



- Major events in the crypto industry (security incidents, black swan events)



- Changes in regulatory policies



- Changes in on-chain liquidity or liquidity contraction



- Market sentiment volatility (panic selling, speculative activity)



Therefore:



- The price of JU2 Token may be highly volatile



- LP participants may experience **impermanent loss**



- Traders may incur losses due to slippage or rapid price changes



JU2 cannot control market trends and does not guarantee long-term token value stability.



### 10.2 Technical Risks



Blockchain technology is still rapidly evolving and carries notable technical risks, including:



**(1) Smart Contract Vulnerabilities**



Although JU2 undergoes multiple rounds of audits, risks may still include:



- Undiscovered logic vulnerabilities



- Unexpected behaviors triggered under extreme conditions



- Cascading risks arising from third-party contracts



**(2) Base Layer Chain Failures**



Issues on the deployment chains (BNB, Arbitrum, Ethereum, etc.) such as:



- Network congestion



- Abnormal gas fees



- On-chain forks



- Service outages or node sync failures



may all affect JU2’s functionality.



**(3) Cross-chain Bridge Risks**



Cross-chain bridges are one of the most frequently attacked components in DeFi, with risks including:



- Contract vulnerabilities



- Multisig key leakage



- Validator node attacks



**(4) Network & Infrastructure Risks**



Failures in nodes, oracles, or RPC services may lead to:



- Abnormal pricing



- Transaction failures



- Delayed or incorrect on-chain data



JU2 will make best efforts to mitigate risks but cannot eliminate them entirely.



### 10.3 Regulatory Risks



Global regulatory attitudes toward crypto assets and DeFi remain inconsistent, including:



- Bans or restrictions on crypto trading or fiat on/off-ramping



- Classifying tokens as securities or requiring registration



- Imposing rules on DEX / DAO / staking models



- Mandatory platform KYC/AML requirements



- Strengthening cross-border regulatory collaboration



Future regulatory changes may affect:



- Trading or circulation of JU2 Token



- JU2’s availability in certain countries or regions



- DAO governance structure and treasury flows



- Launchpad, permissionless listing, and other features



JU2 DAO will closely monitor global regulations and adjust operational models as needed for compliance.



### 10.4 User Operational Risks



Because JU2 is a fully decentralized platform, users bear full responsibility for managing their own assets, including:



**(1) Private Key / Seed Phrase Exposure**



If leaked, assets may be permanently lost; the platform cannot recover them.



**(2) Incorrect Trading Actions**



- Setting slippage too low causing transaction failure



- Setting slippage too high leading to malicious price exploitation



- Sending assets to the wrong address



- Interacting with phishing sites or fake platforms



**(3) Malicious DApps**



Granting approvals to untrusted contracts may lead to:



- Unlimited token approvals



- Theft of LP assets



- Unauthorized token transfers



JU2 recommends users:



- Use official links



- Grant third-party approvals cautiously



- Keep private keys secure



- Perform test transactions before high-value operations



### 10.5 Investment Disclaimer



JU2 Token is **not** a security, equity, or debt instrument. It does not represent ownership of the platform and does not promise any form of profit.



Important notes:



1.  JU2 Token is a **Utility Token**, used for fee discounts, governance voting, incentive rewards, and other functions.



2.  JU2 does not promise or guarantee any token price, yield, or returns.



3.  Investing in JU2 Token may result in partial or total loss.



4.  Past performance does not indicate future outcomes; all yield projections are non-guaranteed.



5.  Users bear full responsibility for risks associated with purchases, liquidity participation, mining, or investment activities.



6.  Some countries/regions restrict or ban crypto trading—users must confirm local laws independently.



JU2 DAO, the development team, and community contributors are **not responsible** for market behavior or user investment decisions.



### 10.6 Limitation of Liability



JU2 DAO explicitly states:



- Not responsible for losses caused by user operational errors



- Not responsible for on-chain force majeure events (network congestion, black swan attacks)



- Not responsible for losses caused by third-party partners (wallets, bridges, etc.)



- Not responsible for losses caused by market price fluctuations



- All contracts operate “**as-is**” without warranties of any kind



JU2 will continue to upgrade security mechanisms but cannot prevent all risks.



### 10.7 Risk Disclaimer Summary



JU2 is committed to reducing risks through multi-layer security mechanisms, compliant governance, and transparent operations. However, the following must be clearly understood:



- DeFi inherently carries high risk



- Blockchain immutability means mistakes are irreversible



- Market conditions are unpredictable



- Regulations continue to evolve rapidly



JU2 advises all users to:



- Fully understand all risks



- Only invest funds they can afford to lose



- Maintain strict private key and operational security



- Respect DAO governance decisions



- Participate in long-term ecosystem building



JU2 aims to build a **sustainable, transparent, open, and community-governed future-oriented decentralized ecosystem**.
